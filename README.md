# Algorithms-via-CSharp
A collection of algorithms in C#

This is an effort to organize the codes and scripts I have fiddled with along the way.
Hopefully this will be useful for C# ers.

The source, inspiration, or assoicated further notes are included.

The code are mostly ready to be executed in c# script mode, eg, RoslynPad, or dotnetfiddle and will link to dotnetfiddle where available.
