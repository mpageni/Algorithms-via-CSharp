# Algorithms-via-CSharp
A collection of algorithms in C#

This is an effort to organize the codes and scripts I have fiddled with along the way.....
Hopefully this will be useful for C# ers.

The code and scripts can definetely found somewhere else, probably not in C#. The source, inspiration, or assoicated further notes are included.

The code are mostly ready to be executed in script mode, eg, RoslynPad, or dotnetfiddle and will link to dotnetfiddle where available.
